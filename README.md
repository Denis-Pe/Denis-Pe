# Hi there 👋

## Denis P

### ❤ What I like

- Low-level programming
- Functional programming
- Embedded programming
- Graphics programming

- ***programming.***

### 😠 What I hate

- Outputting careless code
- When I have unfulfilled potential
- Lack of flexibility

### 📃 What I know

Languages, order of expertise:

- Rust
- C
- Java
- C++
- Python
- Clojure, just started but I love it so far

Miscellanious, no particular order:

- Binary
- Hexadecimal
- Digital Circuits
- Raspberry Pi
- Markdown, as it may be evident
- Data formats: json & toml
- Git, GitKraken, GitHub, as it may be evident

### 🌱 🐣 What I would like to know 

- More Clojure
- More advanced Rust, like all types of macros (I only know how to deal with #[derive] procedural ones currently), to know the standard library like the back of my hand, SIMD, and to be able to dip into unsafe Rust and be as proficient in it as I am proficient in safe Rust
- More graphics programming, compute shaders especially
- Multithreading. I know about atomic types and mutexes and data races and the whole gang, but I won't say I know multithreading until grow enough proficiency to be able to have a picture and clear plan of how I will carry it out when I start writing multithreaded code
- More C and C++, but lesser priority since I am focusing on Rust first. I don't dislike C++, but I already know more Rust and I don't want to make the mistake of trying to grab everything and being left with nothing in terms of knowledge and skill. I first grow top-notch expertise in Rust, and then in C/C++ instead of "knowing" both but I can't honestly call myself an expert in either one
- Just ***more***, I want to be always growing, always learning, always out of my comfort zone because, admittedly, I am obsessed with doing the best I can. And settling for what I already know and just coasting is the total antonym of striving for the best.

### 🛠 The tools I use

Most often:

- Windows
- WSL (Arch)
- [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)
- [Nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell)
- My own personal custom software

Less often:

- IntelliJ IDEA
- Visual Studio 2022

### 🗃 Major libraries and frameworks I use

Most often:

- [Rust egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui)
- [Java JUnit](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5)

Less often:

- [Rust wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu)

***(note that whenever I say often, I mean in terms of frequency of using them in projects, not in terms of using them a lot. I can work a lot on a project using a framework that I don't frequently use for projects)***

### Thank you very much
